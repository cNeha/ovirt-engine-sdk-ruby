# The preferred way to indent long chains of method calls in this
# project is the following:
#
#   @connection.system_service
#     .vms_service
#     .vm_service(123)
#     .disk_attachments_service
#     .attachment_service(456)
#
# But Rubocop by default wants this:
#
#   @connection.system_service
#              .vms_service
#              .vm_service(123)
#              .disk_attachments_service
#              .attachment_service(456)
#
# This parameter adjusts it to the policy of the project.

# The spec for types includes some apparently stupid tests, like
