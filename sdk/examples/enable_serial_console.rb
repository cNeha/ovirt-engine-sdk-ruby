# This example will connect to the server, find a virtual machine and enable the
# serial console if it isn't enabled yet:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Find the virtual machine. Note the use of the `all_content` parameter, it is
# required in order to obtain additional information that isn't retrieved by
# default, like the configuration of the serial console.
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service
vm = vms_service.list(search: 'name=myvm', all_content: true)[0]

# Check if the serial console is enabled, and if it isn't then update the
# virtual machine to enable it:
unless vm.console.enabled
  vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)
  vm_service.update(
    console: {
      enabled: true
    }
  )
end

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
