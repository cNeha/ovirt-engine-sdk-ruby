# This example will connect to the server and create a new OpenStack
# image provider:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Get the reference to service that manages OpenStack image providers:
providers_service = connection.system_service.openstack_image_providers_service

# Add the new provider:
provider = providers_service.add(
  OvirtSDK4::OpenStackImageProvider.new(
    name: 'myprovider',
    description: 'My provider',
    url: 'http://glance.ovirt.org:9292'
  )
)

# The operation to add the provider returns its representation, so we
# can now print some details:
puts "id: #{provider.id}"
puts "name: #{provider.name}"

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
