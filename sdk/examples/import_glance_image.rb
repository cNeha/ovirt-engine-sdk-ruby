# This example shows how to create a new template importing it from an image available in a Glance storage domain.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Get the root of the services tree:
system_service = connection.system_service

# Find the Glance storage domain that is available for default in any
# oVirt installation:
sds_service = system_service.storage_domains_service
sd = sds_service.list(search: 'name=ovirt-image-repository').first

# Find the service that manages the Glance storage domain:
sd_service = sds_service.storage_domain_service(sd.id)

# Find the service that manages the images available in that storage
# domain:
images_service = sd_service.images_service

# The images service doesn't support search, so in order to find the image we need to retrieve all of them and then
# do the filtering explicitly:
image = images_service.list.detect { |i| i.name == 'CirrOS 0.3.4 for x86_64' }

# Find the service that manages the image that we found in the previous step:
image_service = images_service.image_service(image.id)

# Import the image:
image_service.import(
  import_as_template: true,
  template: {
    name: 'mytemplate'
  },
  cluster: {
    name: 'mycluster'
  },
  storage_domain: {
    name: 'mydata'
  }
)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
