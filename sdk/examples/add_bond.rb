# This example configures the networking of a host, adding a bonded interface and attaching it to a network with
# an static IP address.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')

# Find the service that manages the collection of hosts:

# Find the host:
host = hosts_service.list(search: 'name=myhost').first

# Find the service that manages the host:
host_service = hosts_service.host_service(host.id)

# Configure the network adding a bond with two slaves and attaching it to a network with an static IP address:
