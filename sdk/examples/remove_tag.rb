# This example will connect to the server, search for a tag by name and
# remove it:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Find the service that manages tags:
tags_service = connection.system_service.tags_service

# Find the tag:
tags = tags_service.list
tag = tags.find { |x| x.name == 'mytag' }

# Find the service that manages the tag:
tag_service = tags_service.tag_service(tag.id)

# Remove the tag:
tag_service.remove

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
