# This example shows how to pin a virtual machine to a host, so that it will always run in that host.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Get the reference to the root of the tree of services:
system_service = connection.system_service

# Find the virtual machine:
vms_service = system_service.vms_service
vm = vms_service.list(search: 'name=myvm').first

# Update the placement policy of the virtual machine so that it is pinned to the host.
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)
vm_service.update(
  OvirtSDK4::Vm.new(
    placement_policy: {
      hosts: [
        {
          name: 'myhost'
        }
      ]
    }
  )
)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
