# This example shows how export a virtual machine to an export storage domain.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Get the reference to the root of the services tree:
system_service = connection.system_service

# Find the virtual machine:
vms_service = system_service.vms_service
vm = vms_service.list(search: 'name=myvm').first

# Export the virtual machine. Note that the 'exclusive' parameter is optional, and only required if you want to
# overwrite a virtual machine that has already been exported before.
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)
vm_service.export(
  exclusive: true,
  discard_snapshots: true,
  storage_domain: {
    name: 'myexport'
  }
)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
