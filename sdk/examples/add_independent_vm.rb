# This example will connect to the server and create a new virtual
# machine from a template. The disks of the new virtual machine will
# be cloned, so that it will be independent of the template.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine41.local/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service

# Use the "clone" parameter of the "add" method to request that the
# disks of the new virtual machine are independent of the template.
vm = OvirtSDK4::Vm.new(
  name: 'myclonedvm',
  cluster: {
    name: 'mycluster'
  },
  template: {
    name: 'mytemplate'
  }
)
vms_service.add(vm, clone: true)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
