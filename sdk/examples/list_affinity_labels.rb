# This example will connect to the server and print the names
# and virtual machines of all affinity labels in system:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Get the reference to the affinity labels service:
affinity_labels_service = connection.system_service.affinity_labels_service

# Use the "list" method of the affinity labels service
# to list all the affinity labels of the system:
affinity_labels = affinity_labels_service.list

# Print all affinity labels names and virtual machines
# which has assigned that affinity label:
affinity_labels.each do |affinity_label|
  puts "#{affinity_label.name}:"
  vms = connection.follow_link(affinity_label.vms)
  vms.each do |vm_link|
    vm = connection.follow_link(vm_link)
    puts " - #{vm.name}"
  end
end

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
