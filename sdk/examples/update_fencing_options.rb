# This example will connect to the server and change the value of the
# 'lanplus' option of the 'ipmilan' fencing agent of a host.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# The name and value of the option that we want to add or update:
name = 'lanplus'
value = '1'

# Get the reference to the service that manages the hosts:
hosts_service = connection.system_service.hosts_service

# Find the host:
host = hosts_service.list(search: 'name=myhost').first

# Get the reference to the service that manages the fencing agents used
# by the host that we found in the previous step:
host_service = hosts_service.host_service(host.id)
agents_service = host_service.fence_agents_service

# The host may have multiple fencing agents, so we need to locate the
# first of type 'ipmilan':
agents = agents_service.list
agent = agents.find { |x| x.type == 'ipmilan' }

# Get the options of the fencing agent. There may be no options, in that
# case we need to use an empty list:
original = agent.options || []

# Create a list of modified options, containing all the original options
# except the one with the name that we want to modify, as we will add
# that with the right value later:
modified = original.reject { |x| x.name == name }

# Add the modified option to the list of modified options:
option = OvirtSDK4::Option.new(
  name: name,
  value: value
)
modified << option

# Find the service that manages the fence agent:
agent_service = agents_service.agent_service(agent.id)

# Send the update request containg the original list of options plus the
# modifications that we did:
agent_service.update(
  OvirtSDK4::Agent.new(
    options: modified
  )
)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
