# This example shows how to use the SDK when there is the need to use an
# HTTP proxy to connect to the server:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new(
  url: 'https://engine41.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  proxy_url: 'http://proxy.example.com:3128',
  proxy_username: 'myproxyuser',
  proxy_password: 'myproxypass',
  debug: true,
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
)

# Get the reference to the service that manages the virtual machines:
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service

# List the virtual machines
vms_service.list.each do |vm|
  puts "#{vm.name}: #{vm.id}"
end

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
