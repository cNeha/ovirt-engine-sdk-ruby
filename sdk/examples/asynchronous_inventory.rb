# This example shows how to use the asynchronous and pipelining capabilities of the SDK to download from the server
# large amounts of data in an efficient way. A typical use case for this is the download of the complete inventory of
# hosts and virtual machines.

# This combination of pipeline size and number of connections gives good results in large scale environments:
pipeline = 40
connections = 10

# Requests are sent in blocks, and the size of each block shoul be the number of connections multipled by the size
# of the pipeline:
block = connections * pipeline

# This function takes a list of objects and creates a hash where the keys are the identifiers and the values are
# the objects. We will use it to create indexes that we can use to speed up things like finding the disks
# corresponding to a virtual machine, given their identifiers.

  username: 'admin@internal',
  password: 'redhat123',
  ca_file: 'ca.pem',
  log: Logger.new('example.log')
}

# In order to download large collections of objects, it is convenient to use a different HTTP connection for each of
# them, so that they are downloaded in parallel. To achieve that we need to configure the connection so that it uses
# multiple HTTP connections, but not pipelining, as otherwise those requests will be pipelined and executed serially by
# the server.
