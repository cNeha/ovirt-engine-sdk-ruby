# This example will connect to the server and list the disks attached to
# a virtual machine:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
  :log => Logger.new('example.log'),
})

# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service

# Find the virtual machine:
vm = vms_service.list({:search => 'name=myvm'})[0]

# Locate the service that manages the virtual machine:
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)

# Locate the service that manages the disk attachments of the virtual
# machine:
disk_attachments_service = vm_service.disk_attachments_service

# Retrieve the list of disks attachments, and print the disk details.
# Note that each attachment contains a link to the corresponding disk,
# but not the actual disk data. In order to retrieve the actual disk
# data we use the `follow_link` method.
disk_attachments = disk_attachments_service.list
disk_attachments.each do |disk_attachment|
  disk = connection.follow_link(disk_attachment.disk)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
